  <p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Mnemonist-Little-about-Memory/dp/0674576225">The Mind of a Mnemonist</a> by A.R. Luria.  The book
is an intriguing glimpse into a different way of thinking.  Luria describes
several sessions and written exchanges with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Shereshevsky">Solomon Sherashevsky</a>.
Sherashevsky had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">synesthesia</a> and an incredible memory.   The book covers
Luria's interactions with Sherashevsky over the period of about 30 years.</p>

<p><strong>Memory</strong></p>

<p>While Luria describes Sherashevsky's memory as eidetic
(photographic), it isn't anything like what I imagined a photographic memory
would be.  For example, when given a list of words or numbers to memorize
Sherashevsky would not merely take a mental picture of the list.  Instead, he
would construct a scene, often on a road near where he grew up, and place each
item in the scene.  He relied so completely on the vividness of the mental
image he constructed that if he were to place an item somewhere that it would
be hard to see, such as an egg near a white wall, then he might miss it during
recall. Luria also mentioned throughout the book that Sherashevsky was able to
recall lists of various items from their sessions decades prior.</p>

<p><strong>Reality and Imagination</strong></p>

<p>The mental imagery that Sherashevsky created were so real that
they were able to trick both his cognitive processes and bodily function.
Sherashevsky related accounts of how when he was a child he frequently fooled
himself into thinking that time had stopped because he pictured that the hands
on his clock had not moved.  Even more intriguing was when Sherashevsky
demonstrated under controlled conditions his ability to both raise and lower
his heart rate and to change the temperature of his two hands at will.
Sherashevsky's method for these feats was simply to picture himself in
situations which called for it such as running to catch a train or holding a
block of ice.</p>

<p><strong>Control</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately for Sherashevsky, he didn't have much
control over his rich sensory experience.  When reading a story or listening
to someone talk his mind would be flooded with images, sounds, and smells of
all kinds.  While it is likely that this extra sensory information contributed
to his fantastic memory, it also made it very difficult for him to understand
many things that we take for granted.  A simple conversation would force his
mind to wander in whatever direction his synesthesia directed him.  It
required great effort for him to focus on a single topic.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The book covers more topics than I have mentioned here such as Sherashevsky's
personality and the challenges that abstract thought presented him.  Luria's
account of Sherashevsky is a very personal one for a patient and I'm thankful
for that dimension of the story.  It helped me having a real person I could
relate to throughout the story.  This made me wonder about how someone who can
picture such convincing mental representations of people and places would cope
with the loss of a loved one.  It's a wonder to me how he was able to keep his
sanity at all. Luria has a similar work, also in the genre of 'Romantic
Science', titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674546253/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0674576225&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0SBADN0KJ3A0HVZY2VE4">'The Man with a Shattered World: The History of a Brain
Wound'</a> that is probably also worth a look.</p>
