  <p>A few months ago, my friend <a href="http://dpatrickcaldwell.blogspot.com/">Patrick Caldwell</a> started a series of blog
posts about how to land a programming job (<a href="http://dpatrickcaldwell.blogspot.com/2009/11/how-to-land-job-as-software-engineer.html">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://dpatrickcaldwell.blogspot.com/2009/11/your-resume-how-to-land-job-as-software.html">Part 2</a>, <a href="http://dpatrickcaldwell.blogspot.com/2009/11/your-prescreening-how-to-land-job-as.html">Part
3</a>, <a href="http://dpatrickcaldwell.blogspot.com/2009/11/your-interview-how-to-land-job-as.html">Part 4</a>, <a href="http://dpatrickcaldwell.blogspot.com/2010/01/your-communication-skills-how-to-land.html">Part 5</a>, and <a href="http://dpatrickcaldwell.blogspot.com/2010/01/your-field-how-to-land-job-as-software.html">Part 6</a>). I like his advice and think
that it's quite helpful to aspiring developers. However, he did miss one
aspect of the job hunt: finding a job you'll like. Since "like" is a
subjective term I'll just describe the questions I ask prospective employers
during interviews. Currently I work at ThoughtWorks and I love it. I
researched the company very thoroughly before joining. I either asked or
discovered the answers to all of these questions before I accepted their
offer. I'm glad to say that working here has met all of my expectations and
more. Here are the questions that I need answered before I'll work somewhere:</p>

<p><strong>Can I use Open Source Software?</strong></p>

<p>I recently witnessed a project where the team
had to move off of Git for source control because the client had a policy
against using GPL software*. This was rather absurd because they had no plans
to distribute Git or anything using it.  It was merely their source control
system.  Policies like this cause a number of problems for developers and the
team as a whole.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They limit personal freedom by constraining you to a smaller set of tools
than you would have otherwise. They hinder productivity because, for certain
classes of software libraries and tools, the best options are open source (Web
Browsers, Source Control, ORMs, IoC, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>These policies limit your experience and growth. To take this idea to an
extreme consider if you could only use a proprietary language and framework
invented by the company you work for. How useful is that experience to you or
your future employers?</p></li>
<li><p>Policies such as these typically demonstrate a lack of maturity in the
organizations software development practices. Unless your goal is to bring
that maturity to the company then this would be a reason to stay away.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><em>* The funny thing is that their dev severs ran Linux.</em> *</p>

<p><strong>How many different projects will I work on in a typical week?</strong></p>

<p>My motive behind this one feels
like a personal preference but I have yet to meet another developer who
doesn't feel similar on this topic. Before ThoughtWorks, I've had multi-month
stretches where I'll have to work on more than 5 projects a week. Often
multiple in one day. This makes work feel like such a grind. It's unproductive
and harmful to both you and the projects themselves.  Task switching
constantly might make you a little better at multitasking, but it will never
be as effective as single tasking. You will also likely develop some nasty
habits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You'll likely goof off more because you'll seldom be very engaged in what
you're doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Switching tasks will be the norm so as soon as a new one becomes available
you'll be more likely to hop right on it thus losing all the context you've
built up for your current task.</p></li>
<li><p>Since you'll be more error prone (multi-tasking increases your error rate)
this will make you more accepting of errors in your work.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I would be very hesitant to take another job where I'll typically be working
on more than one project in a week.</p>

<p><strong>How do you estimate the time needed to complete work?</strong></p>

<p>Let's face it: there are better developers than you. There
are faster developers, there are more thorough developers, there are slower
developers and there are sloppier developers. Couple that with the fact that
any estimate is just that: an estimate. Be wary of places where the developers
doing the work are not the ones doing the estimating.</p>

<p><strong>What is your software development process?</strong></p>

<p>You should definitely know and be comfortable with how
they develop software. If they have a process, how that process works, how you
as a developer fit into that process, and how flexible they are with that
process. I almost titled this question "Are you Agile?" but decided that would
be too vague. Many companies will claim to practice Agile, XP or Scrum, but
without the details of what they're actually doing you risk making some
incorrect assumptions about how they interpret those labels.  Ask specific
questions around this topic.</p>

<p><strong>Can I talk to someone else?</strong>
Lastly, you should ask to talk to other people you'll be working with. Ideally that would
include developers, BAs, QAs, PMs or team leads of any kind.  Find out how
much they like their jobs and try to get a feel for how you'd like to work
with these people. Your instincts know more than you may think so you should
probably trust your gut on this one.</p>
