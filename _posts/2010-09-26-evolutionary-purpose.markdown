title: Evolutionary purpose

I am really interested in how our minds work. Not
having a background in neuroscience, neurobiology, or neuro-anything for that
matter, I'm currently limited to reading lighter material on the subject until
my understanding goes deeper. I've read books that cover the social side of
how our minds (fail to) work (e.g. [The Drunkard's Walk][1]) and some that are
more technical (but still light) such as [How We Decide][2] and [On Being
Certain][3].

At the moment I'm reading [Seeing Red: A Study in
Consciousness][4]. In it Nicholas Humphrey, the author, aims to present an
evolutionary purpose for consciousness which he argues is independent of
perception. At one point in the book Humphrey writes the following regarding
sensations: _It is fair to assume the capacity has been designed in by natural
selection_.

I take issue with the assumption. I've always had a problem with
this approach to reasoning about any single element of a species. Why must
everything be 'designed in' by natural selection? It seems just as likely to
me that any given attribute we or any other species posses could simply be a
side effect of some other positive attribute which actually was 'designed in'
by natural selection.

To be clear, my issue is not with the notion of human
evolution specifically favoring sensations. A number of reasons come to mind
in support of this point of view. My problem is really the order of the
reasoning. To say that 'This attribute exists, therefore it must have an
evolutionary purpose' seems absurd to me. I find it hard to believe that
random genetic mutations are so delicate as to change only one thing at a time
or that natural selection is so precise to weed out everything except the bare
minimum needed to win.

Unless I'm missing something fundamental with evolution
and natural selection, I suspect that Humphrey only presented his reasoning in
this order for dramatic effect.  After all, it is his stated goal to give an
evolutionary purpose to consciousness.

However, it's still disconcerting how
often I see that logic being used to reason about how we got in our current
evolutionary state. It seems to be quite common among these light-neurosciency
books I've been reading.
